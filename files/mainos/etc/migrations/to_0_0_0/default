# Here are listed all the files and directories that will be preserved during the postupdate. To update the list
# copy this file in a new migration step directory, delete/comment lines to discard currently preserved files and add 
# new entries to preserve more files. Note that this file can be used only to preserve files from etc(rw) before they 
# will be updated with new ones from etc(ro). Remember that at the moment the postupdate is executed the rootfs has 
# already been formatted.
#
# Entries should be specified in one of the following ways:
# - /absolute/path/to/file will preserve the specified file (ie the file won't be overwritten by the postupdate).
# - /absolute/path/to/directory will preserve the directory. This means that the entire content of the 
#         directory will remain as it is (ie additional files in this directory from the update will be deleted).
# - /absolute/path/to/directory/* a shortcut that allows to preserve all the files inside the directory. Additional 
#         files in this directory from the update will be kept.
